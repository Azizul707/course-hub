Here I are the overview of the features of this project.
1. Here is a feature that is not allow any user to select a course twice.
2. A user can get only 20 credits course at a time.
3. Here is another feature which tells a user how much credit hour does he remaining.
4. This project shows tost when a user select one course several time or anyone try to cross the credit limit.

Here is a overview how i manage the state in this assignment project.

In this project I have to work with API so at first I have to declare a state to restore the fetching data.
After fetching and storing the data I used them to build the blog page where I displayed all the courses with all of their crucial information. Then I have implement the cart section where user select courses will be shown. To implement this section I have to manage another state to store the selected data of the user. Here I have to maintain one more feature that a user can select a course one time at a time. After selecting the course I need to show in the cart section how much credit does the user take and how much credit does he remaining. For total credit and remaining credit I have to mange two more state to store those data. In the end I have mange one more state to store course price. In this feature I have displayed how much cost does the user need to bear to buy the course.
